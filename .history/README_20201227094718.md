# anchor-embed-maker

This is a repository for the Anchor.fm embed maker I built. 

You can see it running live [here](https://anchor-embed.jeswebdevelopment.com)

You can also see an article about the code, and what it does [here](https://jeswebdevelopment.com/add-an-episode-index-to-the-anchor-podcasts-embed-player/)
